/**
 * Main PocketBase Hooks File
 *
 * This file serves as the main entry point for PocketBase hooks.
 * All API endpoints have been organized into separate modular files:
 *
 * - dashboard.pb.js  - Dashboard analytics endpoint
 * - feeds.pb.js      - Feed-related endpoints
 * - facts.pb.js      - Fact-related endpoints
 * - networks.pb.js   - Network-related endpoints
 * - nodes.pb.js      - Node-related endpoints
 * - sources.pb.js    - Source-related endpoints
 * - search.pb.js     - Search endpoints
 * - utils.pb.js      - Utility functions and helpers
 *
 * PocketBase automatically loads all .pb.js files in alphabetical order.
 * Each module file contains the relevant API endpoints for that domain.

// Any global configuration or shared hooks can be added here
// For example, global middleware, authentication hooks, etc.
